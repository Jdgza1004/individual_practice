GIT NOTES
git init
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m “whatever I need to say.”
git push

These are the commands to usually use to push anything I am working on in cloud 9 into a repository that my classmates or sensei can do. 
The way I think about it is by two clouds. the one that my friends or others can look into it will only show the last push. the other cloud is the one I am using here on cloud nine or maybe if i wanted to on my machine.
